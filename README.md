# todoapp

After following along with the tutorial by FreeCodeCamp in building a CRUD App in form of a Todo App, I tried to improve is UI experience by adding color themed notes, a dark and light mode too.
I learnt the logic that goes into creating a card or component from filling forms, displaying such card. Also editing the card. Deleting it or removing it totally from its array by the splice method. 
Saving data to localStorage too.
